## About

**cve-search-discord** is a Discord bot that automatically monitors chat messages for CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) identifiers (e.g., `CVE-2023-12345`). When a CVE is detected, the bot fetches detailed information from the [NIST National Vulnerability Database (NVD) API v2.0](https://nvd.nist.gov/developers/vulnerabilities) and presents it in an informative embed directly in the channel.

Key features:
*   Automatic detection of CVE IDs in messages.
*   Fetches details from the official NVD API.
*   Displays CVSS score (v3.1/v3.0/v2.0), vector string, description, publication dates, CWEs, and reference links.
*   Consolidates responses for messages containing multiple CVEs (max 5 embeds per message by default) to prevent spam.
*   Includes a `/version` slash command to check the running bot version.

*   NVD API v2.0

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

*   **Docker** and **Docker Compose** (Recommended for running)
*   OR **Python 3.10+** and **Poetry** (For local development/running)
*   A **Discord Bot Token**. You can create a bot and get a token from the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications).

### Configuration

The bot is configured using environment variables. Create a `.env` file in the project root by copying the example:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Then, edit the `.env` file:

*   `DISCORD_TOKEN` (Required): Your Discord bot token.
*   `NVD_API_KEY` (Optional): Your NVD API key. Request one [here](https://nvd.nist.gov/developers/request-an-api-key) for significantly higher request rate limits. Highly recommended for active bots.
*   `DISCORD_COMMAND_PREFIX` (Optional): The prefix for traditional commands (if any are added later). Defaults to `!`. The primary interaction is automatic detection and slash commands.

### Running with Docker (Recommended)

1.  Ensure Docker and Docker Compose are installed.
2.  Make sure you have configured your `.env` file.
3.  Build and start the container in detached mode:
    ```bash
    docker-compose up --build -d
    ```
4.  To view logs:
    ```bash
    docker-compose logs -f
    ```
5.  To stop the container:
    ```bash
    docker-compose down
    ```

### Running Locally with Poetry

1.  Ensure Python 3.10+ and Poetry are installed.
2.  Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/mauvehed/cve-search-discord.git
    cd cve-search-discord
    ```
3.  Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    poetry install
    ```
4.  Configure your `.env` file.
5.  Run the bot:
    ```bash
    poetry run python main.py
    ```

## Usage

1.  **Invite the Bot:** Invite the configured bot to your Discord server.
2.  **Automatic Detection:** Simply type or paste a message containing one or more CVE IDs (e.g., `Check out CVE-2024-1234 and CVE-2024-5678`). The bot will automatically detect them and post embed(s) with the details.
    *   If multiple unique CVEs are in one message, the bot will post details for up to 5 of them (by default) and indicate if more were found.
3.  **Version Check:** Use the slash command `/version` to see the current running version of the bot.
